My vision of ART-like library

Some of key changes:
- Layout & flow (canvas elements can inherit width of parent, new widgets can be composed using HAML-like ML). Each single widget has Element-complaint API, so you can inject, append or whatever.
- Combination of elements and canvas-widgets. Canvas elements can use usual CSS properties like border, padding, float or whatever.
- Lazy rendering (tries to render as few things as possible)
- Code is DRY-er (e.g. one line to define a new set of states, all logic of managing content is abstracted away)

Code in this repo is not enough to run things, but i'll make a working example if people are interested.

Take a look at ART.Widget.Window, for example.
